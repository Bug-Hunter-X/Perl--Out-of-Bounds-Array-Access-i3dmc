This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an array element beyond its defined bounds.  The `bug.pl` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version with error handling.  This is a subtle error because Perl doesn't throw an exception; it simply returns `undef`.  This can lead to unexpected behavior later in the program if not handled correctly.
